Properly executing defined Conditions of Readiness provide for an orderly curtailment of essential services and operations in the interest of safety of personnel and property. The Commanding Officer of MCAS Cherry Point will evaluate, set, and coordinate Conditions of Readiness for MCAS Cherry Point to include tenant organizations, associated Auxiliary Landing Fields (ALF), and ranges as weather conditions dictate.</p>

									<h3>CONDITIONS OF READINESS SET BY THE COMMANDING OFFICER</h3>
									<p>During the hurricane season, the commanding officer of MCAS Cherry Point sets the following conditions of readiness for the air station based on the current destructive weather threat. Destructive weather conditions are available online at http://www.cherrypoint.marines.mil.<br>
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition V (TCC V):</strong> The potential for the occurrence of destructive weather is elevated but no specific system threatens the area. TCC V indicates a seasonal destructive weather readiness level, i.e., Atlantic Hurricane Season (1 June to 30 November) is in progress or that a specific storm occurring outside of the Atlantic Hurricane Season is forecast to affect the area within 96 hours.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition IV (TCC IV):</strong> A specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater is forecast to affect the area within 72 hours. Partial activation, as required, of the installation EOC.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition III (TCC III):</strong> A specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater is forecast to affect the area within 48 hours. Partial activation, as required, of the installation EOC.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition II (TCC II):</strong> A specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater is forecast to affect the area within 24 hours. Full activation of the installation EOC.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition I (TCC I):</strong> A specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater is forecast to affect the area within 12 hours.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition I Caution (TCC IC):</strong> A specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater is forecast to affect the area within 6 hours.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition I Emergency (TCC IE):</strong> The area is currently experiencing a specific destructive weather system with sustained winds of 50 knots or greater.
									<br><strong>Tropical Cyclone Condition I Recovery (TCC IR):</strong> The destructive weather system has passed the area, but safety and storm hazards remain. All orders, restrictions, and guidance established in previous TCCs remain in effect. The emergency management structure is supporting the speedy return to normal operations by eliminating safety concerns, re-establishing services, utilities, the transportation system, clearing debris, and performing essential repairs.
									<br><strong>All Clear:</strong> The restrictions established in previous TCCs have been canceled. Return to TCC V Atlantic Hurricane season.</p>
